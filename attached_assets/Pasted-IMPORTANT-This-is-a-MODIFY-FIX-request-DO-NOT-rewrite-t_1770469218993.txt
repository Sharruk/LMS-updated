IMPORTANT:
This is a MODIFY + FIX request.
DO NOT rewrite the app.
DO NOT remove existing routes, uploads, file storage, comments, likes, or downloads.
Preserve all working functionality and data.
Only FIX bugs and IMPROVE UI/UX.

=============================
1️⃣ FIX: Admin → Upload Files → "Select Subject" Dropdown
=============================

Current issue:
- When a Class is selected, Subject dropdown stays empty
- Browser shows: “Please select an item in the list”
- Upload is blocked

Required behavior:
1. Subject dropdown must dynamically populate based on selected Class
2. Use the existing SUBJECT_DATA mapping for Classes 9–12
3. When Class changes:
   - Clear previous subject options
   - Load correct subjects for that class
   - Enable Subject dropdown immediately
4. Subject dropdown must:
   - Be disabled until a Class is selected
   - Be enabled after Class selection
   - Always contain valid <option> elements
5. DO NOT hardcode subjects in HTML
6. Load dynamically using existing JS logic (preferred)
7. Prevent form submission unless:
   - Class
   - Subject
   - Exam Type
   - Year
   - File
   are all selected
8. This fix must NOT affect:
   - Existing upload logic
   - File storage
   - Public user pages

Goal:
Admin should be able to:
Class → Subject → Exam Type → Year → Upload
with zero validation or empty-dropdown errors.

=============================
2️⃣ FIX: Subjects Page Showing Raw Object Data
=============================

Current issue:
Subject cards show text like:
{ 'name': 'Tamil', 'is_theory_only': True }

Required fix:
- Display only the subject name (Tamil, English, Maths, etc.)
- Do NOT show raw object or flags in UI
- Use icons + clean subject cards
- Preserve routing and click behavior

=============================
3️⃣ UI CLEANUP: Subject → Exam Category Page (STUDENT VIEW)
=============================

Current problems:
- Too many empty rows with “0”
- Repeated zero states
- Cluttered, confusing layout

Required UI-only changes (NO backend changes):

1. Do NOT show individual exam rows when file count is 0
2. Show only category-level cards with total count:
   Example: “Unit Tests (0)”
3. Replace per-row “0” badges with single category count
4. Use collapsible / accordion UI:
   - Categories collapsed by default
   - Expand only when count > 0
5. Hide irrelevant exam categories by subject:
   - Remove “Practical Exam” for:
     Tamil, English, Maths, Commerce, Social Science
   - Keep “Practical Exam” ONLY for:
     Science, Computer Science
6. Order categories as:
   Unit Tests →
   Midterm →
   Quarterly →
   Half Yearly →
   Annual →
   Public Exam →
   Practical (if applicable)
7. Add a friendly empty-state message at the bottom:
   “Question papers will be added soon. Please check back later.”

Goal:
Make the page clean, minimal, student-friendly.
No repeated zero rows.

=============================
4️⃣ UI IMPROVEMENT: Admin → Review / Moderate Comments
=============================

Functionality is working — UI is poor.

Redesign Admin → Review Comments UI:

Required:
1. Use a clean table or card-based layout
2. Each comment should clearly show:
   - Comment text
   - Username
   - File name (clickable)
   - Class / Subject / Exam Type
   - Date & time
3. Clear action buttons:
   - Hide
   - Unhide
   - Delete
4. Visually differentiate:
   - Active comments
   - Hidden comments
5. Add confirmation before delete
6. Keep this page ADMIN-ONLY

Do NOT change:
- Comment storage
- User comment flow
- Public file pages

=============================
5️⃣ ADMIN NAVIGATION CLEANUP
=============================

- Remove “Upload” or admin-only links from public navbar
- Admin pages must be accessible ONLY via:
  /admin → login → dashboard
- Public users must never see admin controls

=============================
FINAL RULES
=============================

- Preserve ALL working functionality
- Preserve routes, URLs, and data
- Do NOT downgrade features
- This is a FIX + UI REFINEMENT pass only

END GOAL:
A clean, professional Tamil Nadu State Board portal where:
- Admin can upload/manage without bugs
- Students see a simple, clutter-free interface
- Everything works reliably
